# Conways GameOfLife Unity

## The algorithm 
Conways game of life is an algorithm is a cellular automaton. 

## Rules - 

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Plan 

I plan to make a real time unity game in which you can spawn cells at any time. 
I need - 
* A grid
* A way to spawn cells 
* an implentation of the algorithm
